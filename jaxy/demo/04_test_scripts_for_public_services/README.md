## Test scripts for Public Services ( open_services )  [ ( watch the demo ) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmiSug6571Q&list=PLgd4yhA9GWz3lc2XmuW1lwlH3sjT4gHwa&index=7&t=6s)
 
  In this_demo, we will see how to **generate** a **bash_client** for **public_services** ( **non-secure services** ). 

  We will **focuse** on the **service "plane"**
  
--------


  *  1- Let's open the file_configuration  ( **demo 04** ) :   

```               
        vim jaxy/demo/04_test_scripts_for_public_services/serviceConf.yaml 
```
 
  **Note :** The **configuration file** used in this **demo** is the **same** as the one **used previously**


--------

  *  2- Launch jaxy : 

```	   
       ./run.sh  serviceConf=jaxy/demo/04_test_scripts_for_public_services/serviceConf.yaml
```
      
----

  * 3- Go to the WEB-UI : 
  
```	   
       http://localhost:8080/
```

----

   **Copy** ( or **Download** the script **generated by jaxy** )


   **Run it ( using the following command line ):**

```
          ./jaxy_client.sh
```

  As it is a **public service** ( **No need** for any **password** )
  
----

#### Filetering : 


  * 1- Let's now Filter the planes and keep only those :


               distance_km  >  11000      ( AND )

               distance_km  <  16000     

  * 2- Let's add another Filter on the model :


               total_passengers   =  524    


  * 3- Let's **KEEP** ONLY the following **FIELDS** ( in the result ) :


               - model
